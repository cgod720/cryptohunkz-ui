				The CryptoHunkz are originally from PLANIT PHITNEZZ. They have dedicated
				their entire lives to being the strongest in the universe and have taken
				the oath of the PUMP. The presence of the Hunkz caused much disruption
				to the leaders of PLANIT PHITNEZZ and as such they introduced the
				creation of the 'HUNKZ ALERT'. Fed up with being surrounded by
				weaklings, the Hunkz decided to leave PLANIT PHITNEZZ and establish
				their presence as the strongest in both the universe and the metaverse.
				Take the oath of the PUMP and join the CryptoHunkz on their journey. Do
				you have what it takes?
